Apart from this, all members actively took part in testing and debugging the code.



Description

---------------------------------------------------------


The goal of this assignment is to implement a B+-tree index. The index should be backed up by a page file and
pages of the index should be accessed through your buffer manager. 


How to run

-----------------------------------------------------------


1. Open terminal and Clone from BitBucket to the required location.

2. Navigate to assignment4 folder.

3. Use make command to execute btree manager, test_assign4_1, run:
	$ make all

  then run
  $ ./test_assign4_1

4. Use make command to execute test expr, test_expr,
	$ make test_expr

  then run
  $ ./test_expr

5. To clean,
	$ make clean







----------B Tree Functions------------

1) initIndexManager():
  Used to initialize Btree.

2) shutdownIndexManager():
  Used to shut down index manager

3) createBtree():
  Used to allocate memory to Btree


4) openBtree():
  Opens Btree pagefile

5) closeBtree():

---------Access Functions------------

7) getNumNodes():
  Used to give the number of nodes in the tree

8) getNumEntries():
  Gives the number of entries in a Btree

9) getKeyType():
  Used to return the key type whether int, string etc

--------Index Access Functions----------

10) findKey():
   Used to find the position of the key

11) insertKey():
   Used to insert key into the btree

12) deleteKey():
   Used to delete a key from the Btree

13) openTreeScan():
   Used to scan the trees

14) nextEntry():
   Used to read the next entry into the Btree


15) closeTreeScan():
   Used to close the scanning of the tree elements
